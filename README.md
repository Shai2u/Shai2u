## Shai Sussman

### Data Scientist and GIS Developer/Analyst

I specialize in geospatial development and analysis (GIS), and in recent years, I have transitioned into the field of Data Science. My experience in geospatial data analysis, spatial modeling, and GIS solutions has given me a strong foundation to apply data science techniques like machine learning, data modeling, and statistical analysis. I am eager to use my unique expertise to solve complex problems and create impactful, data-driven solutions.
Key Experience:

- Machine Learning & Data Science: Applied machine learning and neural networks within the geographic domain to drive data-driven solutions, and now expanding into broader Data Science challenges.
- Open Source GIS Solutions & Development: Expertise in geospatial data analysis, GIS plugin development (QGIS), and building mapping websites with technologies like React and MapLibre, GeoServer.
- Python Programming: Strong proficiency in Python, with experience in data manipulation, automation, and analysis.
- ESRI ArcGIS: Extensive experience working with ESRI ArcGIS including online, Expeirence, arcade, Python/Javascript API
- Cloud & Linux Technologies: Familiar with AWS cloud platforms and Linux-based systems (especially Ubuntu), leveraging these tools for data management and analytics.
- I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in Data Science across the full spectrum of development—from designing impactful data models and building innovative prototypes to deploying solutions that address real-world challenges. Driven by a passion for continuous learning and growth, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with dynamic teams, and leverage my skills to deliver high-impact, practical results.

I am also open for remote work in similar topics as above, please see my [fiverr profile](https://www.fiverr.com/shai_sussman), and feel free to contact [me](mailto:shai.sussman@gmail.com)!
