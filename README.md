## Shai Sussman

### Data Scientist and GIS Developer/Analyst

I have a diverse GIS background, with experience spanning public transportation, academic research, freelance work, large corporations, and government projects. This broad expertise in development and analysis has naturally led to my transition into Data Science.

In addition to my analytical Data Science experience, I also bring web development skills (Back/Front end) and a solid understanding of Linux systems (Ubuntu). These capabilities allow me to prototype, build, and deploy impactful solutions efficiently, bridging GIS and Data Science with innovative web applications.

Passionate about bridging the gap between modeling, prototyping, and deployment, I am eager to apply my expertise in Data Science, GIS, and web development to create meaningful, high-impact solutions.
